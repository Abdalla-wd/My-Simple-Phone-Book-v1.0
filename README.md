simple description:
---------------------

it was created by me using php, mysql and little html. It basically allows you to enter contact data and then view them and delete them if you want.

-----------------
How to install:
-----------------
1 - Download all files and copy them to your web server or local server.

2 - open config.php in notepad or text editor and add your database connection data (host, username, password and database name).

3 - open install.php in your browser. It will automatically connect to the database using the informatio you added in the config.php file and then it will create the table "contacts" in your database.

4 - After the table is created, you can close, and even delete install.php, and open the index.php file  using your web browser and it will display any the existing contacts and allows you to delete users and link you to the addcontact.php where ypu can add new contacts.
